- 👋 Hi, I’m Paul Theby
- 👀 
- 🌱I'm currently, as of late Feb '24, working on a full stack project, with mainly Angular and Rails, for insurance agents to share customers that are non-renewing/help them find coverage.
- 💞️ I learn everyday by reading, working on projects, helping others, learning from others,  and meeting people looking to do the same. 
- 📫 How to reach me; paultheby@gmail.com
